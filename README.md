### JASM

*NEWS: Switch to CMake, read below for instructions*

*URGENT: JASMCLI marked as deprecated, will be replaced soon*

JustAnotherSystemMonitor

*What is this?*

Just Another System Monitor is a system monitoring daemon which interfaces with CLI and GUI, it wants to be hackable and modular, you can build modules for JASM easily... Wait until we get a functional monitoring monitor.

*Would you like to contribute?*

Anyone is accepted! Join us!

*Supported Operating System(s)?*

Unix-like operating systems are supported, but we are planning to use GNU C Libraries and Linux kernel APIs

*Noobs: how to compile?*

We just switched *CMake* build automation tool!
Configure this project almost everywhere!
Follow instructions below (as we suggest) 

*Compiler*

We use GCC with -O2 -pipe -Wall -std=c11 flags which can be changed inside Makefiles in cli/ and core/ changing CFLAGS

*Nerdy*

We use C11

### GIT HOOKS

 This repository uses git hooks to keep working tree clean,

### USE CMAKE (IMPORTANT)
 
 As you read above, we just switched to cmake, now you can configure this project even on Windows, but we will give you instruction for GNU/Linux (and almost UNIX and Unix-like OS)

 CMake is a build-automation tool, with it you can build project files (from XCode to VS) and Makefiles! (Cross-platform Make)

 Follow this instructions

 * Be sure you are using GCC
 ~~~
 $ export CC=/usr/bin/gcc
 ~~~
 You should change your shell's rc and add above line to the rcfile.
 If you are using a shell like fish (it is NOT POSIX compilant)
 ~~~
 $ set -x CC /usr/bin/gcc
 ~~~

 * Well, you are in JASM directory... Now?
 We already created a directory called "buildenv", CMakeFiles are configured to use it
 ~~~
 $ ls buildenv 
 ~~~
 *probably it is empty, if no output, then it is right*

 * Change directory, configure, compile
  Now it's time to compile!
  ~~~
  $ cd buildenv/
  ~~~
  ... configure via cmake
  ~~~
  $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/gcc -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=$(uname)-$(uname -m)
  ~~~
  *Explaination: cmake checks for CMakeLists.txt in the '..' directory*
  * -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Relase : means that the build must be "Release", but you may want to use "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug"
  * -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/gcc : tells cmake what compiler should use, it is not really necessary if you set CC=gcc (*INFO: for CXX, same thing but its CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER*)
  * -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local : installs binary in /usr/local/bin
  * -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=$(uname)-$(uname -m) : sets os. name and arch. (highly suggested)
  Then, we can launch make
  ~~~
  $ make -j2
  ~~~
  Now make (-j2 = 2 jobs working...) does all the stuffs and you can find jasm to ../bin/jasm ; if you used the Debug: ../bin-debug/jasm
  You may want to know what happens in the backend
  ~~~
  $ make VERBOSE=1 -j2
  ~~~
  
  Now, go below to the install parameter, jumping instructions below

 * Now, you may want to delete buildenv content, just use
 ~~~
 $ rm -rf *
 ~~~
 *Inside buildenv/*

 * You can also use clean rule
 ... if you want to rebuild 
 ~~~
 $ make clean
 ~~~
 *Inside buildenv/*
 
 *NOTE: YOU CAN SWITCH TARGET USING -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug, re-using cmake*
 
 *Don't delete jasmbuild_info.h.in*
 
 *Change version number using CMakeLists.txtx (howto in file)*

### Versions

 * develstage: high-development stage, then we get 0.0.9, before getting 0.1.0

### Project Structure

 * bin/: where binaries are placed after compilation
 * data/: for now, we use data for logging (logging works only from bin/ [development stage :) ])
 * doc/: where documentation is placed, an italian one is availible (Markdown!).
 * src/: where sources are placed
 * Makefile: we are using make to handle project, easily hackable!
 * LICENSE: Licensed under GNU GPL v3 [Contains the LICENSE]
 * README.md: hey :)

### Modules / Getters

As I said before, JASM wants to be easily hackable, so we are providing tools to create new modules for this System Monitor:

 * Modules: time-functional stats/feature (such as CPU Usage) [src/main/jasm/modules]
 * Getters: non-time-functional stats/features (such as Machine nodename)

### Dependencies

 * Nothing

### Install

 Be sure to be *root* (id -u = 0)

 then, inside buildenv:
 ~~~
 make install
 ~~~

 Done

 * What does this installs on my system?
  * /usr/local/bin/jasm
  * /etc/systemd/system/jasm.service

### Packaging

 For now, you can build deb and rpm packages thanks to CPack

 Inside buildenv (as root):
 ~~~
 make package
 ~~~

 :)

 * Deb = works
 * Rpm = to check

 We will provide tgz individually

### Platform

 * JASM Core: Development 
 * JASM CLI: Current release marked as deprecated! Will be replaced soon...
 * JASM Qt: Development
 * JASM Swing: Starting...
 * JASM on Android: Not started yet
 * Getters/Modules: before, the core, after getters/modules

### Files
 * $HOME/.jasm_config: JASM Configuration file *IMPLEMENTING* {*WIP*}

### Branches

 On main repository we are going to create new branch "stable"
 * master : main-development branch
 * stable : stable releases (less bugs, more functions)
