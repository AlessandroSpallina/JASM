### JASM

JustAnotherSystemMonitor

*What is this?*

Just Another System Monitor is a system monitoring daemon which interfaces with CLI and GUI, it wants to be hackable and modular, you can build modules for JASM easily... Wait until we get a functional monitoring monitor.

*Would you like to contribute?*

Anyone is accepted! Join us!

*Supported Operating System(s)?*

Unix-like operating systems are supported, but we are planning to use GNU C Libraries and Linux kernel APIs

*Noobs: how to compile?*

Just type make, the output directory is bin/ :)

*Mmh... Ok, other make rules?*

 - clean (cleans object files and other things)
 - cleanbin (cleans bin/ directory except placeholder to avoid bin directory gets deleted from git when staging)
 - debug [builds a *debug* release(debug symbols,no optimization,preproc opts...)]

*Compiler*

We use GCC with -O2 -pipe -Wall -std=c11 flags which can be changed inside Makefiles in cli/ and core/ changing CFLAGS

*Nerdy*

We use C11

### Versions

 * develstage: high-development stage, then we get 0.0.9, before getting 0.1.0

### Project Structure

 * bin/: where binaries are placed after compilation
 * data/: for now, we use data for logging (logging works only from bin/ [development stage :) ])
 * doc/: where documentation is placed, an italian one is availible (Markdown!).
 * src/: where sources are placed
 * Makefile: we are using make to handle project, easily hackable!
 * LICENSE: Licensed under GNU GPL v3 [Contains the LICENSE]
 * README.md: hey :)

### Modules / Getters

As I said before, JASM wants to be easily hackable, so we are providing tools to create new modules for this System Monitor:

 * Modules: time-functional stats/feature (such as CPU Usage) [src/main/jasm/modules]
 * Getters: non-time-functional stats/features (such as Machine nodename)

### Dependencies

 * Nothing

### Shared obj , headers [system-wide]

 - shared object -> lib/libjasm.so
 
 which contains -> modules.o , logger.o 
 
 copied to -> /usr/lib/libjasm.so
 
 - header -> src/main/jasm/core/modules.h , src/main/jasm/core/logger.h

 which contains -> modules arrays / funct , logging functions 

 copied to -> /usr/include/jasm
 
 Those libs/headers are useful to create external modules, as soon as possible we will write how on the wiki

### Install
 Just execute install.sh, this will copy binaries, libs,service and headers, to your system
 *remember to copy data/jconfig to /home/username/.jasm_config*
 
 
### Platform

 * JASM Core: Development 
 * JASM CLI: Development
 * JASM GTK2: Not started yet
 * JASM on Android: Not started yet
 * Getters/Modules: before, the core, after getters/modules

### Files
 * $HOME/.jasm_config: JASM Configuration file *IMPLEMENTING* {*WIP*}

### Branches

 On main repository we are going to create new branch "stable"
 * master : main-development branch
 * stable : stable releases (less bugs, more functions)
